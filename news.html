    <h4 style='padding: 10px;'>by Elizabeth Grace Saunders</h4>
    <p style='padding: 10px; text-align: justify;'>When faced with new goals, it’s easy to jump in with both feet. But having staying power to sustain this initial energy is difficult. Many of us may eventually disengage, while others pushing themselves so hard they burn out. Still others might vacillate between the two.

        The key to success isn’t starting strong, it’s staying strong. You need to self-regulate. First, set upper and lower boundaries for what you need to do to make progress on a goal in a specified amount of time, like a day or a week. Second, understand how you tend to work — if you work hard and fast to the point of exhaustion, work slowly and find yourself scurrying to the finish line, or somewhere in between — and make adjustments accordingly. Third, building time for rest and recovery based on your work tendency. Finally, create breathing room in your schedule for dedicated work.</p>

    <h4 style='padding: 10px;'>by James Clear</h4>
    <p style='padding: 10px; text-align: justify;'>Let's define productivity. Productivity is a measure of efficiency of a person completing a task. We often assume that productivity means getting more things done each day. Wrong. Productivity is getting important things done consistently. And no matter what you are working on, there are only a few things that are truly important.

        Being productive is about maintaining a steady, average speed on a few things, not maximum speed on everything.</p>

    <h4 style='padding: 10px;'>by Adam Grant</h4>
    <p style='padding: 10px; text-align: justify;'>A few years ago during a break in a leadership class I was teaching, a manager named Michael walked up looking unsettled. His boss had told him he needed to be more productive, so he had spent a few hours analyzing how he spent his time. He had already cut his nonessential meetings. He couldn’t find any tasks to drop from his calendar. He didn’t see an obvious way to do them more efficiently.

        “This is going to sound like a joke, but it’s not,” he confessed. “My only idea is to drink less water so I don’t have to go to the bathroom so many times.”</p>
